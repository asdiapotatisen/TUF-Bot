Discord bot that creates ships and fleets for TUF. Currently a Work-In-Progress

## Things to do
### Fixes
- Bot running code in two channels instead of one
- Bot saying nation has been created when it has not
### Content

- Send summary to other channel once completed (for mod purposes)
  - Mod approval system?
- Use .json or .txt files to write info?
  - Pros:
      Everything won't be lost if the bot restarts
  - Cons:
      Takes time to learn
